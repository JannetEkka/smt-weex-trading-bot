  [JUDGE] Gemini: WAIT (90%)
  [JUDGE] Reasoning: The market is in Extreme Fear (F&G=7), which requires at least two co-primary signals to confirm a SHORT trade. While WHALE is strongly SHORT (68%), FLOW is weakly LONG (40%), failing to meet this critical condition. Furthermore, SENTIMENT indicates a RISK_OFF environment with HIGH_RISK volatility due to upcoming catalysts, and microstructure shows medium chop, making a clear directional trade too risky at this time.

  [JUDGE] Gemini: SHORT (85%)
  [JUDGE] Reasoning: The market is in an 'Extreme Fear' state with strong taker selling (FLOW 85% SHORT) and whale distribution (WHALE 59% SHORT). Multiple negative catalysts and a RISK_OFF macro environment (SENTIMENT 80% SHORT) suggest a continued downward move, aligning with a CATALYST_DRIVE strategy. Given the high volatility risk, confidence is set at 85% due to the strong agreement across primary signals.

  [JUDGE] Reasoning: The market faces a HIGH_RISK volatility event with US economic data releases at 1:30 p.m. GMT, requiring >=85% confidence to trade. While FLOW shows strong SHORT pressure (85%), WHALE indicates mild LONG sentiment (58%), creating conflicting primary signals. This, combined with an Extreme Fear F&G index (7) which biases towards contrarian LONG, prevents reaching the necessary high confidence for a directional trade during this high-risk period.

  [JUDGE] Reasoning: Both WHALE (50% LONG) and FLOW (30% NEUTRAL) signals are weak and do not provide a clear directional conviction. The WHALE signal itself is contradictory with on-chain accumulation but bearish prediction market sentiment. Furthermore, the SENTIMENT report indicates a HIGH_RISK volatility environment due to upcoming economic data and Fed speeches, which requires a confidence of 85% or higher to trade. With no strong co-primary signals and high market uncertainty, waiting is the most disciplined action.

Despite extreme fear (F&G=7), 3+ personas (FLOW, SENTIMENT, TECHNICAL) confirm SHORT, overriding the F&G short asymmetry rule.

  [JUDGE] Reasoning: The strong FLOW (85% LONG) indicates significant taker buy pressure and bid depth. Despite the 'Extreme Fear' sentiment (F&G=7) and bearish macro news, the F&G index suggests a contrarian LONG bounce is possible, and the 'SHORT ASYMMETRY' rule prevents a SHORT trade. The market is currently in a tight range (MEDIUM CHOP), and strong FLOW could initiate a move towards the upper boundary. Epoch strategy is RANGE_BOUNDARY.

  [JUDGE] Reasoning: The strong WHALE accumulation (80% LONG) in an extreme fear market (F&G=7) suggests a potential upward move. Microstructure indicates a breakout from a tight range is imminent, aligning with a momentum play. Despite neutral FLOW and high volatility risk, the primary WHALE signal is compelling for a LONG.

  [JUDGE] Reasoning: The two co-primary signals, WHALE (85% LONG) and FLOW (85% SHORT), are in direct and strong contradiction. This, combined with the HIGH_RISK volatility event from upcoming US GDP & PCE Data release, necessitates a WAIT decision. No clear 4-5H target can be established amidst conflicting strong signals and macro uncertainty.

  [JUDGE] Reasoning: The market is in an EXTREME FEAR regime with HIGH_RISK volatility due to upcoming macro catalysts, requiring >=85% confidence for any trade. While WHALE (72% LONG) and FLOW (60% LONG) agree on a bullish direction, their combined strength does not meet this high confidence threshold.

  [JUDGE] Reasoning: MOMENTUM_CROSS strategy selected. Strong FLOW (85% taker buy pressure) and on-chain whale accumulation indicate upward momentum, supported by a contrarian LONG bias from the extreme fear F&G index. Despite macro risk-off sentiment, immediate buying pressure suggests a breakout from the current tight range.

  [JUDGE] Reasoning: WHALE data shows strong accumulation (+185 ETH) and FLOW indicates strong bid depth, both supporting a LONG position. The Fear & Greed Index at 7 (Extreme Fear) suggests a potential contrarian bounce from current levels. While microstructure shows medium chop, the positive long-term catalyst of the BlackRock ETH staking ETF could drive price towards a structural resistance level.

  [JUDGE] Reasoning: WHALE (72% LONG) and FLOW (85% SHORT) signals are in strong contradiction, indicating no clear directional edge.
