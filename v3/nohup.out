  [SENTIMENT] SHORT (90%): ADA has broken down through key support levels, including $0.358 and $0.334, and is currently testing lower price levels, with the next significant support at $0.28. This downward movement is exacerbated by nearly $2 million in long liquidations for ADA, which typically fuels further downtrends.

  [WHALE] Analyzing...
  [WHALE] NEUTRAL (40%): Whale activity balanced: -3 ETH
  [SENTIMENT] Analyzing...
  [SENTIMENT] NEUTRAL (60%): Bitcoin experienced significant long liquidations totaling $563 million to $745.3 million in the last 24 hours, following a drop to a nine-month low of $81,200 on January 29, 2026. Despite this, current data from Kraken shows 83% buyers versus 17% sellers, indicating strong buying interest at current levels, and overall trading volume has increased by 18.50% from the previous day. This suggests a potential consolidation or bottoming process after a shakeout of over-leveraged long positions, rather than a clear directional break.

  [SENTIMENT] SHORT (90%): XRP experienced a significant price drop of 3.14% to 7% in the last 24 hours, accompanied by a 'violent long flush' resulting in $57 million to $71 million in long liquidations, far outweighing short liquidations. This indicates strong selling pressure and a breakdown in price, forcing bullish leveraged positions to close.

  [SENTIMENT] SHORT (70%): SOL has experienced a price decline of approximately 1.5% to 4.7% in the last 24 hours, trading within a daily range of $112.97 to $122.93. This downward movement is accompanied by high trading volume (around $7-8 billion), suggesting active selling pressure. The price remains in a clear downtrend on the daily timeframe, staying below both the 9-day and 21-day moving averages, indicating that sellers are in control of short-term price action. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 35.53, signaling weak momentum and nearing oversold conditions, while the MACD shows a negative crossover. Although SOL is currently defending a key support zone around $112-$115, the overall momentum and price action point to continued bearish pressure.

  [SENTIMENT] NEUTRAL (60%): DOGE experienced a slight price decline over the last 24 hours, but conflicting volume data and the absence of clear support breaks prevent a strong directional call. While some sources indicate decreased spot trading volume, others suggest a surge in overall daily trading volume, making it difficult to ascertain if volume is spiking on red candles.

  [SENTIMENT] SHORT (80%): Bitcoin has broken down through multiple key support levels, including $88,604 and $86,000, with signals indicating further potential decline. This downward price action was accompanied by a significant volume of long liquidations, suggesting leveraged buyers were forced to sell.

  [SENTIMENT] SHORT (90%): ETH has broken down through key support levels (around $2956 and $2800), and a substantial amount of long positions ($175 million) have been liquidated in the last 24 hours, significantly outweighing short liquidations.

  [SENTIMENT] SHORT (80%): ADA has experienced a significant price decline of 3-8% in the last 24 hours, pushing it to critical support levels around $0.28-$0.318. This downward movement is accompanied by increased trading volume and substantial long liquidations, indicating strong selling pressure and a potential for further drops if these support levels are broken.
